# EMEC Access Management System (EMEC-AMS)

## About

EMEC-AMS is an IoT-driven access management and analytics system designed for the Engineering Manufacturing Education Center at Colorado State University.  
It connects **Raspberry Pi**, **RFID**, **relay**, and **LCD** modules with a **FastAPI** backend and an **Azure MySQL** database to control and track student access to lab machines in real time.

The system authenticates users through RFID cards, grants or denies access, logs every session, and syncs data between a local SQLite database and the cloud for reporting and analysis.
